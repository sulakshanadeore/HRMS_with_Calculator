1 solution ---- M projects
solution is composed of UI and Logic


Solution Name:HRMS 
Project Name:HRConsoleApp(User Interface)---ConsoleApplication
BusinessLogicLayer:Logic of the application(ClassLibrary.dll)---Reusability feature without repeating the code

How to create the dll?
1) create a class library project
2) write the code
3)build the code/library---> u will get (.dll)


**App(UI) is dependent on the (Class Library)logic
1) dll ---> App can use the code, by adding reference of the dll in the app.
2) all methods must be public.



2 projects

app         library
Main         logic-->compile the library

				

In my library, I am going to add a class and write functionalities for calculator.

Assemblies:output unit/basic unit of deployment/version info/MSIL
Exe/Dll
App/Library

1) Private 

2) Public/Shared: A single .dll ---- multiple projects-----
*)Sign the assembly and give rights to be used
*) It doesn't create copies of itself when it is public,
*) Instead it is shared from the GAC(Global Assembly Cache) folder.
A public key token is generated and that is used by the assemby/s who want to the class library.
One Class library can be used by another class library.
Global Assembly Cache Location: C:\Windows\assembly


3) Satellite: Language assemblies are a good example of Satellite Assemblies.
Localisation: locale/Karnataka----Kannada
Globalisation: WeekDays/Dates/Months/Currency/


App---- English----> applicationform.en-us.cs
        Hindi------>applicationform.hi-in.cs
	Marathi-----> applicationform.mr-in.cs
	Punjabi

Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------

What is OOP?
Object Oriented Programming.
Paradigm/way of working with problems.
It divides the program into smaller parts and we refer them as object.
Pre-defined template to store the object data, pre-defined object template : Class/BluePrint



Employee:Class
Empid Ename City  Edu  Age birthdate BasicSal TA  DA HRA ---characteristic

AcceptData-----procedure
DisplayDAta---procedure
CalculateAge---procedure
CalculateSalary---procedure



PersonData
multiple persons data, so we wnat to store separately.

	p1      p2      p3
Nmae:Ankita  Ashwini Gaurang
 Age:  2        3	   5

treat each person separately.

Procedural Paradigm/Functional Programming: C Language
It divides the programs into small chunks which we call them functions.


4 major pillars of oops
1)Abstraction:Hiding unnecessary things and  showing the relevant.
Real World Example: Mobile calling feature
		    Drive a car----> start/stop/gear etc.

Achieve: Access Specifiers
	public
	private
	internal
	protected
	protected internal

2)Encapsulation: putting all thihgs related to each other in a single unit.
Real World Example: Medicine Capsule
Achieve: binding fields(state of the object) and the behaviour(method) together in a single unit(class).
                      method acts on the data(variables/parameters)
3)Polymorphism:  Multiple forms  of a method behaviour.
	Poly --many / morphism----forms
         Pay my Electricity bill: Cash/UPI/DebitCard/CreditCard

Overloading
Overriding

4)Inheritance: Reuse the code 
	Multiple Inheritance
	Multi-Level Inheritance
  Base-Parent/Derived---Child




3 Minor Pillars
1) Typecasting:
2) Persistence: Storing--- File/Memory/Object/DB
3) Concurrency: Multi-threading/Parallelism
